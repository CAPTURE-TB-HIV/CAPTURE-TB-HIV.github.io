# About Us

CAPTURE is a 2-year grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held by LSHTM and Harvard. Our overall aim is to improve locally driven priority setting by HIV and TB programs, leading to more efficient and equitable HIV and TB prevention and care programs.
Project outcomes include:
* improved & validated methods for transference, extrapolation and estimation of cost functions and societal costs
* improved methods for ‘adaptive’ collection of primary cost data
* improved accessibility of unit cost data for application to modelling analyses
